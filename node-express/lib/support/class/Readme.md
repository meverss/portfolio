# Class.js

  High performance classical inheritance for **node.js**.

## Installation

  Install the [Kiwi package manager for nodejs](http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi)
  and run:
  
      $ kiwi -v install class

## About Class.js

Without wasting performance on cross-browser functionality,
class.js is an **extremely light** (_20-ish SLOC_) class implementation.

By utilizing idiomatic prototypal inheritance techniques this
implementation is **very fast**. There are no wrapping or _super_ 
hacks involved.

## Features

  * Fast
  * Tiny
  * Mixin support with included() hook
  * Subclassing support with extended() hook

## Examples

    var Class = require('class').Class

    var User = new Class({
      extend: {
        extended: function(subclass){
          // called when User.extend() is called,
          // in this case passes Admin
        }
      },
      constructor: function(name){
        this.name = name
      },
      toString: function(){
        return '[User ' + this.name + ']'
      }
    })
    
    var Admin = User.extend({
      constructor: function(name) {
        User.call(this, name.toUpperCase())
      }
    })
    
    var SomeMixin = new Class({
      extend: {
        included: function(superclass){
          // called when Admin.include()
          // is called, in this case Admin
          // will become the contents of "superclass"
        }
      },
      foo: 'bar'
    })
    
    Admin.include(SomeMixin)
    
    puts(new Admin('tj'))
    // => "[User TJ]"
    
## Benchmarks

Currently the benchmarks compare regular **prototypal inheritance**,
node's **sys.inherits()**, and **class.js**. Each subclasses _User_
as _Admin_, and creates an instance **500,000 times**.

    Î»  class.js: node benchmark.js

    running 500000 times

    prototype : 68 ms
    sys.inherits() : 1512 ms
    class.js : 2510 ms

## Running Tests

Specs are written using [JSpec](http://jspec.info), however
no additional installations are required as JSpec is froozen
to _spec/lib_, just simply run:

    $ make test
